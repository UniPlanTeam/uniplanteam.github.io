description: "With the advent of technology came the demise of many traditional jobs and careers. Many students that are considering a college degree or are currently in the process of earning their degrees, are concerned that such aspirations can be useless if their jobs are automated away by high tech. Others believe that college degrees are the key to a secure career, and thus, a secure future.

In this fourth episode of The Study Space, we evaluate the validity of such beliefs and give our opinions on them. We talk about the value of skills and how to think about what the future might bring.
