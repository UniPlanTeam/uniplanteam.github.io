description: "In this episode, we talk about academic dishonesty in the age of remote learning. The coronavirus pandemic has forced universities across the country to close their doors and transition to fully remote, distanced learning. This new mode of learning has brought up concerns within academia regarding academic dishonesty and other related infractions upon academic integrity.

We'll discuss a recent virtual townhall held for the Georgia Tech community at large regarding academic integrity and the implications of several strategies that some universities across the United States use to maintain that integrity.
