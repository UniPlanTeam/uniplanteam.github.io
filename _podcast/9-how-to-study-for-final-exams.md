-   In college, you should learn how you learn, and how to learn better
-   Start early to give yourself time in the future

-   Critical thinking involves thinking of creative, new solutions to problems

-   Julian spent less and less time studying for final exams as he approached graduation
-   Learning how you learn allows you to better estimate how much time and effort needed to study

-   Only ask for help after putting in your best effort to solve a problem
-   When asking for help, say what you’ve already tried
-   Looking at past papers gives you insight to the format of exams and helps focus study efforts
-   If a professor has no past papers, pay attention to what they say will be on an exam
-   Problems or questions that a professor personally creates is indicative of what will be on the exam
-   Study topics that you’re struggling with, not the ones that are easy
-   Have a study plan
-   Form a study group

-   Sleep, and sleep well
-   Create a cheatsheet even if they aren’t allowed for the exam
