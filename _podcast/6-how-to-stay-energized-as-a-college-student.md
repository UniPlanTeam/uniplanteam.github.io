description: "Perhaps the easiest thing about being a college student is feeling tired all the time. You can feel as though you have no energy for numerous reasons. When juggling homework, studying, career, and life, feeling overtired comes as no surprise to anyone. So how do people do it? How do other students seem to get through college just fine when you feel so exhausted from everything? 

In this episode of The Study Space Podcast, we try to answer these questions and show you how to stay energized as a college student. We talk about the perpetual cycle of fatigue and how falling behind has the dangerous tendency of causing you to fall even more behind. We also propose some quick solutions that have worked for us to stay energized."
