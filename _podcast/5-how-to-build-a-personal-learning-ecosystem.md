description: "Many students are likely aware that different people learn new concepts differently. Often times the conversation resolves to three main categories of learners: auditory, kinesthetic, and visual. This framework can certainly be helpful for many students to identify their preferred method of learning, but we think there’s a more helpful way to reinforce your learning. 

In this episode of The Study Space Podcast, we discuss a higher-level concept for learning new topics and skills: personal learning ecosystems. We define what exactly is a personal learning ecosystem, how to build one, and how having one can benefit a college student. We discuss our own personal learning ecosystems and how we nurture it to reinforce our learning and development."
