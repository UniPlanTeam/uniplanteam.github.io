description: "In this episode of The Study Space Podcast, we discuss our opinions on legacy admissions and their implications for college students applying to certain universities. We talk about what legacy admissions are, which schools have historically had preference for legacy students, and the arguments for and against having preferences for legacy students.

Legacy preference in the college admissions process is nothing new. For the overwhelming majority of students looking to apply to famous schools in the United States, legacy preference is something that is not at the forefront of their minds. The focus is primarily on their academic performance and what extracurricular activities they have to demonstrate in their applications. However, for some schools, the additional variable of legacy status is one that can tip the scales between admission and rejection. This episode discusses this very variable."
