description: "For most, college is a strenuous yet exciting time: students often find themselves working through adversities and toward self-discovery. This adage cannot ring more truly for international students who must navigate through life in a foreign country while juggling the hardships that come with a college education. 

In this episode of the Study Space Podcast, we take a trip down memory lane with Sai Sathyanantha as he recounts both difficult and pleasant moments during his time at San Jose State University  as an international student.
