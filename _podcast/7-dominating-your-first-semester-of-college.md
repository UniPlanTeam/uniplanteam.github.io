description: "For new students unaccustomed to college life, feeling as though you need to start your first semester or term off strong is natural. Many students define “dominating” their first semester as getting a 4.0 GPA, landing an internship, or participating in research opportunities with their professors. While these are all noble aspirations, success is not solely comprised of academics.

In this episode of The Study Space Podcast, we discuss how to dominate your first semester of college by looking back at our first semesters and talking about the things we did right, but also things we did wrong or could have done better."
