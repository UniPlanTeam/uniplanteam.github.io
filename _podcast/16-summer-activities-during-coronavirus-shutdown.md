description: "In this episode, we talk about several professional development activities to do during the coronavirus shutdown over the summer.

As days, weeks, and months go by with COVID-19 running rampant across the globe, the likelihood of a summer reprieve from the pandemic seem slim. For many students, their internships, jobs, and other projects are being cancelled. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t do anything to develop your professional skills over the summer."
