description: "In this episode of The Study Space Podcast, we talk to Andre Vu, a pre-medical student attending Johns Hopkins University to get his insights on the pre-med track, medical school, and how to overcome the challenges inherent with those goals. We discuss the competitiveness and pressure of being a pre-med, and how to deal with them. We talk about activities, research, and life as a pre-med student.


Becoming a doctor is an admirable, but daunting goal. The competition is on and pressure is high. The rewards can be great, but the steps to get there are numerous and difficult. In this episode, we aim to uncover what life is like for one pre-med student at Johns Hopkins University, and what advice he has for students like him."
