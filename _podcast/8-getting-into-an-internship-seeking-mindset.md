description: "To think that you need to focus on getting good grades and being immersed in the college experience is completely normal. These are all important parts of being a successful student. However, going off to college is but one fleeting stage in life that prepares you for the life ahead of you. The goal for many students is to become professionals in their chosen fields. While your academic performance is important in accomplishing such a goal, getting an internship is arguably a great deal more important. 

In this episode of The Study Space Podcast, we discuss how to get into an internship-seeking mindset and how to begin your search for internships. We talk about the different ways in which we’ve looked for internships and which approaches we found worked better for us."
