Many students believe that going to college means giving up all of your free time to studying and doing homework--that all semblance of school-life balance gets thrown out the window. This can certainly be true for some students, but the reality is that you usually have much more control over your schedule.

In this episode of The Study Space, we discuss how we approach this idea of “balance” in our lives and what that really means. We cover the activities in which we participated and how they affected our time, attention, and energy. We also talk about our reasons for making certain decisions and evaluating our priorities.
