description: "It is much easier to form habits than to abandon them, and, once formed, these behaviors often dictate choices and day-to-day activities. Building a series of beneficial habits is a great way to maintain a consistent routine; however, with a few bad ones mixed in, failure is always looming overhead. 

We here at the Study Space Podcast have formed plenty of bad habits and made plenty of terrible decisions during our short year at university. In this episode, we discuss the consequences of our actions as well as how we rectified our mistakes, so you can avoid forming these idiosyncrasies in the first place.
