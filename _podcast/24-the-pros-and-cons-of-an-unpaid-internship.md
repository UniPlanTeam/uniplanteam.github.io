description: "For many students, internships are an integral part of the college experience, and, for many employers, internships are an integral part of an application. Although some are fortunate enough to get important experience as well as a paycheck, many find themselves as an unpaid intern and wondering if unpaid internships are worth their time and effort. 

In this episode of the Study Space Podcast, we examine the pros and cons of an unpaid internship, discuss our opinions on the matter, and recount our own experiences as interns.
