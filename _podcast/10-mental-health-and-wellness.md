description: "In this episode of The Study Space Podcast, we discuss our experiences with mental health concerns, the resources that are available to students, and some tips on how to help yourself mitigate the stresses of college such that you avoid developing mental health issues. 

There is no doubt that college is a stressful experience. Obviously, if it were easy, everyone would have advanced degrees and never complain about deadlines and school. Unfortunately, when college stress grows too great, students can develop numerous mental health problems that affect academic performance."
