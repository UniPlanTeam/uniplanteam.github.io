description: "In this episode, we are joined by Minh Duong, a high school student who recently had to take his AP exams virtually due to the closing of school in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Studying for AP exams is hard enough normally. With the pandemic, students were not only forced to quickly transition to remote, distance learning, but to take their exams under entirely different circumstances. 

We’ll discuss Minh’s experience with the virtual AP exams, the technical issues therein, and other implications of the AP exams. We’ll also talk about some of the opinions students had with these virtual AP exams and how the College Board has responded to their complaints.
