description: "In this episode of The Study Space Podcast, we talk about how to get into “the flow” and what that means for your productivity. We discuss the benefits of getting into the flow, our experiences with what our work has been like while in the flow, and how we have personally coaxed ourselves into the flow state. We also dive into some resources and quick tips you can apply to help yourselves get into the flow.


Students struggle with concentration and focus all the time, especially when there are so many distractions around us today. However, we have all had that out-of-body experience where we have been so hyper-focused that we lose all track of time while we work with seemingly endless concentration and motivation. We think this is something you can learn to control."
