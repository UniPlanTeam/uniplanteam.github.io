description: "In this episode we are joined by Michael Pham, a community college student, who will help us describe the differences between going to a community (or junior) college and going to a 4-year university. As the school year comes to an end, many students find themselves needing to decide between going straight to a 4-year university or a 2-year college. This is a very important decision to make that can have very impactful consequences.

We’ll discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages to going to a 2-year college as opposed to a 4-year university right out of high school. We’ll also talk about some unique qualities of 2-year colleges that put them ahead of universities for some students.
