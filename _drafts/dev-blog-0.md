## Introducing UniPlan

UniPlan started as a small idea. The idea initially came to me in high school when I started to take my personal productivity and focus very seriously.

While my high school was gracious enough to provide me with a traditional paper planner to use, I found that there was too much friction in having to pull it out of my book bag to write down homework assignments. Homework was usually announced at the end of class after the bell rang, which forced me to stay back for several minutes to take it down and took away from what little time I had to walk to my next class. My planner felt like a hindrance instead of a helpful tool, and I reverted to storing everything in my head.

I ended up migrating to digital tools to organize my entire life after getting an iPad for Christmas. Despite this, I still felt that there was too much friction in organizing my schoolwork because I had to use a bundle of apps to do so comprehensively.

At this point, I started thinking about how great it would be to have a single app to that would allow me to manage my school schedule, todo list, calculate grades, organize my extracurricular activities, and sync all this data across all of my devices. This was the impetus for UniPlan.

UniPlan’s mission is to remove as much friction from the act of organizing as possible so that students can spend more time doing than planning.

In accordance to this mission, one of UniPlan’s unique features is that it optimizes your schedule according to when you feel most energized. UniPlan can learn the unique ebbs and flows of your mood and energy by asking you how you’re feeling throughout the day. Over time, UniPlan develops a model of you feel on a typical day. With this model, UniPlan schedules your most important tasks at the times when you feel more energized to boost your productivity.

This is but one of UniPlan’s great set of capabilities. If you’re interested in becoming directly involved in the development of UniPlan’s features, we are always eager to hear your suggestions. To get started, sign up to be a beta tester and help us build the best tool for students.
