        Have a Question or Feature Request for UniPlan?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We're in the process of setting up a Discord server for UniPlan where
        you can get answers to all your questions regarding UniPlan and the
        Study Space Podcast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feature requests can be made there as well. If you would like to see our
        backlog of features that we're in the middle of developing, we'll be
        publicizing our issue tracker soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to contribute to the UniPlan conversation if you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>need help with using UniPlan</li>
        <li>want to request a feature to be added to UniPlan</li>
        <li>have a bug or issue to report</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We'll address questions about UniPlan and how to use it as much as we
        can, but if you have an answer to someone else's question, feel free to
        answer it! We encourage community and camaraderie. However, the core
        team would like to focus on developing the app further, so our
        priorities will go to responding to bugs, issues, and feature requests.
      </p>
